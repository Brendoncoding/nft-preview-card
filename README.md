## My process


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I'm learning more and more on how position works on css and html, still have much more to learn, but im pretty happy with the results, i know that
positioning objects with css grid and flexbox is way easier and more practical but i did not learn those yet, only know they by name, hope my next 
project i will be able to use flex and grid. I was able to do a really cool hover effect on my image, was a real challenge, got that information
on (www.w3schools.com) and now i got an idea on how to make that by myself.

### Continued development

Stil have much more to learn on positioning elements, hope that by doing this awesome projects provided by (https://www.frontendmentor.io/) i will
be able to improve my skills with css.

### Useful resources

- [Image Overlay fade](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This helped me learn how to create a overlay effect on hover on my image.
